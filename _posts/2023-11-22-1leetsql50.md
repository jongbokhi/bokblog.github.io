## 1.Question
<div class="notice--warning">
Write a solution to find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).
</div>
## 2.Key concept
- MySQL: DATEDIFF(), DATE_ADD()
- Postgres: INTERVAL

### 2.1 DATEDIFF()
```sql
<MySQL>

SELECT w1.id

FROM Weather AS w1 , Weather AS w2

WHERE w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature AND DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate , w2.recordDate) = 1

```
### 2.2  DATE_ADD()

```sql
<MySQL>
SELECT
  t1.id
FROM
  Weather t1
  JOIN Weather t2 ON t1.recordDate = DATE_ADD(t2.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
WHERE
  t1.temperature > t2.temperature;

```
### 2.3  INTERVAL
```sql
<PostgreSQL>

SELECT
  t1.id
FROM
  Weather t1
  JOIN Weather t2 ON t1.recordDate = t2.recordDate + INTERVAL '1 day'
WHERE
  t1.temperature > t2.temperature;
```
